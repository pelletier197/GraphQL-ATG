   *  - '[Type]' : In highest priority is the list matcher. If you need to provide a custom list for a specific type.
   *               If you don't need anything specific in the list, you can u#se the second matcher.
   *
   *  - 'Type' : Your type directly. If there is a direct match for this key, it will be used first.
   *             This factory will also be used when generating a list if no list factory is provided.
   *
   * - '*Type':  You type with wildcard. It is more useful if you have many types that you would want empty by default.
   *             For instance, some applications may have different filters that you would want empty by default, which would give:
